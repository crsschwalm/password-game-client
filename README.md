This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Rules of the game

### Setup

- _Required:_ 4 players in the same room, 2 teams of 2 players
- Teams have 1 hint giver and one hint guesser
- Meant to be played over video call or in person to communicate allowed!

### For Hint Givers 🤔

- **1 Word!**
- Can use proper nouns, but remember 1 word rule, use first or last name only
- If your teammate guesses wrong, click to skip your turn
- If your teammate guesses right, click to score and end the round

### For Guessers 🤷‍♂️

- **1 Guess!**
- No "Table Talk"

> **_Example Play_**
>
> Teams: Jack & John **vs** Abby & Allison
>
> Jack and Abby start as Hint givers while John and Allison will guess.
>
> Round starts and Team 1 is up!
>
> - Jack see's the password "Box", thinks of a hint and says allowed "Cube".
>   - John hears "Cardboard" and guesses "Ice", but is wrong
>   - Jack clicks the button to skip their turn.
>
> It's now Team 2's turn
>
> - Abby gives the hint "Cardboard"
>   - Allison guesses "Box"
>   - Abby Clicks score! to end the round, score a point, and start a new round
